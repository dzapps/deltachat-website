<h2>General</h2>
<h3>To whom can I write?</h3>
<ul>
<li>With Delta Chat, you can write to users using Delta Chat - or any other existing
e-mail-client. This is one of the biggest differences to other messengers:
There is no need for the receiver to install the same app as yours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the advantages of Delta Chat compared to other messengers?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Independent</em> of any company or services. <em>You</em> own your data.</li>
<li>Your data are not saved on a central server; this way, in contrast to most other messengers, Delta Chat even protect your metadata (who writes to whom?)</li>
<li>You do not distribute your address book to anyone.</li>
<li><em>Fast</em> by the use of Push-IMAP</li>
<li><em>Largest userbase</em> - receivers <em>not</em> using Delta Chat can be reached as well</li>
<li><em>Compatible</em> - not only to itself</li>
<li><em>Elegant</em> and <em>simple</em> user interface</li>
<li><em>Distributed</em> system</li>
<li><em>No Spam</em> - only messages of known users are shown by default</li>
<li><em>Reliable</em> - safe for professional use</li>
<li><em>Trustworthy</em> - can even be used for business messages</li>
<li><em>Secure</em> - You can lock the app with password</li>
<li>fully <em>OpenSource</em> and <em>Standards</em> based</li>
</ul>
<h3>What, if the receiver does not use Delta Chat?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The receiver will get a normal email then - if he replies to it, you will
see the reply in the Delta Chat app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does Delta Chat support images, videos and other attachments?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Beside the plain text, all email-attachments are displayed as separate
messages. Outgoing messages will get attachments as needed automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does Delta Chat support HTML-emails?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes.  If incoming email lacks a plain text part, we convert HTML-emails to
plain text ourself.  Outgoing emails always use plain text. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
<h3>How can I create a group?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Add group</strong> from the &quot;Sandwich menu&quot; in the upper left corner of the chat overview.</li>
<li>On the following screen, select the <strong>group members</strong> and hit the checkmark in the upper right corner. After that, you can define a <strong>group name</strong>.</li>
<li>As soon as you write the <strong>first message</strong> in the group, all members are informed about the new group and can answer in the group (as long as you do not write a message in the group the group is invisible to the members).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who can add members to a group?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every group member has the <strong>same rights</strong> as any other. For this reason every one can delete every member or add new ones.</li>
<li>To add or delete members, click on the group name in the chat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I have deleted myself by accident.</h3>
<ul>
<li>As you're no longer a group member now, you cannot add yourself again.  However, no problem, just ask any other group member in a normal chat to add you again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I do not want to receive the messages of a group any longer.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Either delete yourself from the member list or delete the whole chat. If you want to join the group later again, ask another group member to add you again.</li>
<li>As an alternative, you can also &quot;Mute&quot; a group - doing so, you'll get all messages and can still write but you're no longer notified of any new messages.</li>
</ul>
